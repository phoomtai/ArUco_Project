# ArUco Marker-Based Sitting and Standing Posture Evaluation

This project utilizes ArUco markers with a Python-based system to evaluate sitting and standing postures. It integrates SQLite for database management and Streamlit for the user-friendly front-end interface.

## Overview

The project aims to assess sitting and standing postures using ArUco markers as reference points. Real-time posture evaluation is achieved through marker detection and analysis.

## Features

- **ArUco Marker Detection:** Identifies and tracks markers for posture evaluation.
- **Posture Evaluation:** Analyzes sitting and standing positions based on marker data.
- **SQLite Database Integration:** Efficient storage and management of posture-related information.
- **Streamlit Front-end:** Interactive interface for visualizing and analyzing posture evaluations.

## Dependencies

- **Python Libraries:**
    - OpenCV (ArUco marker detection)
    - SQLite3 (database management)
    - Streamlit (front-end interface)

 ## Note: Senior Project (Work in Progress)

This project is part of my senior project and is still a work in progress. Contributions and feedback are appreciated as the project continues to evolve.
